/**
 * Class to read quad encoders.
 * @deprecated : use QuadratureEncoder instead.
 *
 * Quadrature encoders are devices that count shaft rotation and can sense
 * direction. The output of the QuadEncoder class is an integer that can count
 * either up or down, and can go negative for reverse direction counting. When
 * creating QuadEncoders, a direction is supplied that changes the sense of the
 * output to make code more readable if the encoder is mounted such that forward
 * movement generates negative values. Quadrature encoders have two digital
 * outputs, an A Channel and a B Channel that are out of phase with each other
 * to allow the FPGA to do direction sensing.
 *
 * All encoders will immediately start counting - Reset() them if you need them
 * to be zeroed before use.
