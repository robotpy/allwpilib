 * Class to read quadrature encoders.
 *
 * <p>Quadrature encoders are devices that count shaft rotation and can sense direction. The output
 * of the Encoder class is an integer that can count either up or down, and can go negative for
 * reverse direction counting. When creating Encoders, a direction can be supplied that inverts the
 * sense of the output to make code more readable if the encoder is mounted such that forward
 * movement generates negative values. Quadrature encoders have two digital outputs, an A Channel
 * and a B Channel, that are out of phase with each other for direction sensing.
 *
 * <p>All encoders will immediately start counting - reset() them if you need them to be zeroed
 * before use.
 *
 * @deprecated use {@link QuadratureEncoder}
